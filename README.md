# NLP_HW6

## Introduction
This is a Homework at JHU CS 665 - Natural Language Processing Course. In this project, we built three part-of-speech taggers: HMM (Hidden Markov Model), CRF(Condition Random Field), and CRF with BiRNN (Bidirectional Random Field) word embedding.

## Setup
Please run 
```conda env create -f nlp-class.yml``` under /code directory. And run  ```conda activate nlp-class```
