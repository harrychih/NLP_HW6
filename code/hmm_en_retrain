British/N Airways/N said/V its/D shareholders/N accepted/V only/R 6.3/J %/N of/I the/D convertible/N capital/N bonds/N ,/, but/V that/I the/D rest/N of/I the/D issue/N will/M be/V taken/V up/R by/I underwriters/N ./.

But/R except/V for/I the/D embarrassment/N ,/, British/N Air/N will/M emerge/V relatively/V unscathed/N from/I the/D flopped/N issue/N ./.

In/I late/N trading/N on/I London/N 's/P Stock/N Exchange/N yesterday/N ,/, the/D shares/N were/V off/R three/C pence/N at/I 194/N pence/N ./.
And/N because/I British/N Air/N is/I issuing/N convertible/N bonds/N rather/R than/V ordinary/I shares/N ,/, the/D share/N price/N wo/M n't/R be/V directly/W hurt/V by/I any/D surplus/N left/V with/I underwriters/N after/I they/P try/V to/T sell/V the/D issue/N in/I the/D open/J market/N ./.
But/C British/N Air/N 's/P withdrawal/N from/I the/D UAL/N buy-out/N could/M have/V further/I repercussions/N ./.
Some/C analysts/N speculated/V yesterday/R that/I the/D move/N has/V set/V off/I a/D board/N room/N split/N ,/, which/W may/M lead/V to/T the/D resignation/N of/I Sir/N Colin/N Marshall/N ,/, the/D carrier/N 's/P chief/J executive/N officer/N ./.

The/D article/N is/V ,/, unfortunately/N ,/, replete/N with/I outrageous/N distortions/N ./.
One/N of/I Mr./N Roberts/N 's/P observations/N is/V that/I the/D Bank/N 's/P own/P loan/N portfolio/N is/V in/I deep/J trouble/N because/V of/I its/D lending/N to/T developing/V countries/N ./.
This/N is/V just/R not/V so/R ./.
The/D reality/N is/I that/D Bank/N finances/N are/V rock/R solid/V ./.
As/N of/I June/N 30/N ,/, 1989/` --/: the/D day/N our/P past/J fiscal/N year/N came/V to/T a/D close/J --/: only/J 4.1/N %/N of/I the/D Bank/N 's/P portfolio/N was/V affected/V by/I arrears/N of/I over/C six/C months/N ./.
This/N is/I an/D enviably/N low/J level/N ./.
Moreover/N ,/, the/D Bank/N follows/I a/D prudent/J provisioning/N policy/N and/I has/D set/N aside/I $/$ 800/C million/C against/I possible/J loan/N losses/N ./.
For/E the/D same/J fiscal/N year/N ,/, by/I the/D way/N ,/, the/D Bank/N 's/P net/N income/N was/I a/D robust/J $/$ 1.1/C billion/N after/I provisions/N ./.
Because/N of/I the/D business-like/N manner/N in/I which/W the/D Bank/N goes/V about/I development/N ,/, financial/J markets/N have/V confidence/N in/I it/P ./.
This/N helps/N explain/V the/D triple-A/N rating/N enjoyed/V by/I our/P bonds/N and/I our/P ability/N to/T borrow/V $/$ 9.3/C billion/N in/I fiscal/N 1989/N on/I the/D most/J advantageous/N terms/N ./.
Another/N of/I Mr./N Roberts/N 's/P criticisms/N is/I that/D Bank/N lending/N has/V done/V more/R harm/V than/I good/J ``/N by/I implanting/N the/D wrong/J incentives/N and/C deflecting/N energy/N away/R from/I economic/J development/N ./. ''/'
Here/N ,/, too/R ,/, Mr./N Roberts/N is/I way/N off/I the/D mark/N ./.
The/D reality/N is/I that/D Bank/N loans/N have/V been/V linked/V to/T policy/N improvements/N for/I 40/N years/N ./.
Our/N traditional/C project/N loans/N have/V ,/, for/I instance/N ,/, supported/V sensible/J energy/N pricing/N in/I the/D power/N sector/N ,/, sound/N interest-rate/N policies/N in/I the/D credit/N area/N and/I the/D operation/N of/I public/J utilities/N as/I efficient/J ,/, autonomous/J agencies/N ./.

In/I my/P home/N region/N ,/, Latin/N America/N ,/, much/R of/I the/D existing/J infrastructure/N base/N --/: an/D important/J building/N block/V for/I development/N --/: has/V been/V financed/V by/I the/D World/N Bank/N ./.
Mr./N Roberts/N also/N takes/I a/D swipe/N at/I the/D Bank/N 's/P adjustment/N lending/N ./.

The/D Bank/N has/V been/V making/V adjustment/N loans/N for/I 10/N years/N ./.
As/N their/P name/N implies/V ,/, these/J operations/N are/V linked/V to/T far-reaching/C policy/N reforms/N that/I aim/N at/I helping/J borrowing/N countries/N get/V back/R on/I the/D growth/N path/N and/C at/I enhancing/N their/P credit-worthiness/N ./.
Typically/N ,/, these/J measures/N include/I reforms/N to/T downsize/V the/D role/N of/I government/N and/C parastatals/N in/I the/D economy/N ,/, to/T open/V up/R inward-looking/J economies/N to/T international/J competition/N and/C to/T promote/V the/D development/N of/I a/D vigorous/N private/C sector/N ./.
Support/N for/I the/D private/J sector/N has/V been/V a/D longstanding/J concern/N of/I the/D Bank/N 's/P ./.
Over/N the/D years/N ,/, it/P has/V helped/J encourage/N investments/N by/I entrepreneurs/N in/I the/D Third/N World/N through/I its/D extensive/J credit/N operations/N and/C through/I loans/N and/C investments/N by/I the/D International/N Finance/N Corp/N ./.
Most/C recently/N ,/, the/D Bank/N Group/N has/V been/V expanded/V to/T include/V the/D Multilateral/N Investment/N Guarantee/N Agency/N to/T stimulate/V direct/D foreign/J investment/N in/I developing/J countries/N by/I offering/N guarantees/N against/I noncommercial/N risk/N and/C advice/N to/T member/N countries/N on/I how/W to/T improve/V their/P business/N climate/N ./.

It/P 's/P easy/P to/T get/V something/R comparable/V by/I simply/R moving/V to/T a/D higher/J altitude/N in/I the/D U.S/N ./.
Moreover/N ,/, there/E are/V questions/N ,/, particularly/V among/I atmospheric/N scientists/N who/W know/V this/D subject/J best/N ,/, about/I the/D ability/N of/I anyone/N to/T know/V what/R in/I fact/P is/V happening/V to/T the/D ozone/J layer/N ./.
It/P is/V generally/R agreed/V that/W when/W CFCs/C rise/N from/I earth/N to/T stratosphere/N ,/, the/D chlorine/N in/I them/P is/V capable/V of/I interfering/N with/I the/D process/N through/I which/W ultraviolet/M rays/M split/V oxygen/N molecules/N and/C form/N ozone/N ./.
But/U ozone/J creation/N is/I a/D very/N large-scale/C natural/J process/N and/I the/D importance/N of/I human-generated/N CFCs/N in/I reducing/J it/P is/V largely/I a/D matter/N of/I conjecture/N ./.
The/D ozone/J layer/N is/I constantly/N in/I motion/N and/C thus/W very/V hard/R to/T measure/V ./.
What/W scientists/N have/V known/V since/V the/D late/N 1970s/N is/I that/W there/E is/I a/D hole/N in/I the/D layer/N over/I Antarctica/N that/I expands/N or/V contracts/N from/I year/N to/T year/N ./.
But/U it/P is/V at/I least/J worthy/N of/I some/J note/N that/W there/E are/V very/R few/J refrigerators/N in/I Antarctica/N ./.
Moreover/N ,/, surely/V someone/W has/V noticed/V that/D household/N refrigerators/N are/V closed/V systems/N ,/, running/V for/I many/J years/N without/V either/V the/D CFC/N gas/N or/V the/D insulation/N ever/V escaping/N ./.
Another/N argument/N of/I the/D environmentalists/N is/I that/W if/R substitutes/V are/R available/E ,/, why/R not/R use/V them/P ?/.
Mr./N Teagan/N cites/I a/D list/N of/I substitutes/N but/V none/R ,/, so/V far/R ,/, match/V the/D nonflammable/N ,/, nontoxic/N CFCs/N ./.
Butane/N and/C propane/N can/M be/V used/V as/D coolants/N ,/, for/I example/N ,/, but/R are/V flammable/N ./.
Moreover/N ,/, new/I lubricants/N will/M be/V needed/V to/T protect/V compressors/N from/I the/D new/J formulations/N ,/, which/W ,/, as/V with/I CFCs/N ,/, are/V solvents/N ./.
Mr./N Teagan/N points/N out/R as/V well/R that/W if/V the/D equipment/N designed/V to/T get/V along/R without/I CFCs/N is/V less/R efficient/J than/I current/J devices/N ,/, energy/N consumption/N will/M rise/V and/I that/W will/M worsen/V the/D greenhouse/N effect/N ./.
Folks/N in/I the/D Midwest/N who/W just/R suffered/V a/D mid-October/N snowstorm/N may/M wonder/V where/I the/D greenhouse/N was/I when/W they/P needed/V it/P ,/, but/R let/V 's/P not/V be/V flippant/N about/I grave/N risks/N ./.
As/N it/P happens/V ,/, Arthur/C D./N Little/N is/V not/R at/I all/J interested/N in/I throwing/V cold/J water/N on/I ozone/J depletion/N and/I global/J warming/N theories/N ./.

There/E is/V ,/, after/I all/C ,/, big/J money/N in/I environmentalism/N ./.

University/N professors/N and/C consultants/N with/I scientific/J credentials/N saw/V a/D huge/J market/N for/I their/D services/N evaporate/N when/I price/N decontrol/N destroyed/V the/D energy/N crisis/N and/C thus/I the/D demand/N for/I ``/C alternative/J energy/N ./. ''/'
They/N needed/V new/I crises/N to/T generate/V new/I grants/N and/C contracts/N ./.
In/I other/J words/N ,/, environmentalism/N has/V created/V a/D whole/J set/N of/I vested/J interests/N that/W fare/V better/R when/W there/E are/V many/I problems/N than/I when/W there/E are/V few/R ./.
That/W tends/V to/T tilt/V the/D public/J debate/N toward/I ``/N solutions/N ''/' even/V when/R some/V of/I the/D most/J knowledgeable/J scientists/N are/V skeptical/N about/I the/D seriousness/N of/I the/D threats/N and/I the/D insistence/N of/I urgency/N ./.

Playing/` black/D in/I the/D first/J game/N ,/, the/D human/J champion/N maneuvered/N Deep/N Thought/N ,/, known/V for/I its/D attacking/J prowess/N ,/, into/I a/D totally/N passive/N position/N ./.

And/N in/I the/D second/J game/N ,/, with/D Mr./N Kasparov/N advancing/N ferociously/N as/I white/N ,/, D.T./N offered/V feeble/J resistance/N and/C lost/V even/V faster/R ./.
Well/U ,/, mankind/N can/M rest/V easier/P for/V now/R ./.
Though/N almost/V everybody/R at/I the/D playing/J site/N had/V been/V looking/V for/I the/D 26-year-old/N Soviet/N to/T beat/V the/D Pennsylvania-based/N computer/N ,/, he/P gave/V the/D machine/N a/D far/R worse/J drubbing/N than/I many/J expected/N ./.
And/U when/W Mr./' Kasparov/C strode/N into/I the/D playing/J hall/N ,/, he/P called/V the/D outcome/N ./.
As/N if/V he/P were/V Iron/N Mike/N ,/, about/C to/T enter/V the/D ring/N with/I a/D 98-pound/N weakling/N ,/, he/P declared/V :/: ``/` I/P 'll/M be/V able/V to/T beat/V any/D computer/N for/I the/D next/N five/C years/N ./. ''/'
His/P strategy/N against/I D.T./N was/V based/V on/I a/D thorough/J study/N of/I dozens/N of/I its/D games/N ,/, he/P said/V ,/, including/I its/D notorious/J whippings/N of/I the/D grandmasters/N Bent/N Larsen/N of/I Denmark/N and/C Robert/N Byrne/N of/I the/D U.S./N Mr./N Kasparov/N was/I underwhelmed/N ./.
``/` The/D computer/N 's/P mind/N is/V too/R straight/R ,/, too/V primitive/R ,/, ''/' lacking/V the/D intuition/N and/C creativity/N needed/V to/T reach/V the/D top/N ,/, he/P said/V ./.
The/D champion/N apparently/V was/V not/R worried/V at/I all/C about/C D.T./N 's/P strong/J points/N ./.
Its/U chief/J builder/N ,/, Taiwan-born/C Feng-hsiung/N Hsu/N ,/, nicknamed/V his/P brainchild/N ``/C the/D Weasel/N ''/' for/I its/D tactical/J flair/N at/I wriggling/N out/I of/D horrible/J positions/N ./.
D.T./` also/R has/V a/D prodigious/N and/C flawless/N memory/N ,/, is/D utterly/J fearless/N ,/, and/C could/M n't/R be/V distracted/V by/I the/D sexy/J nude/N sculptures/N spread/V around/I the/D playing/J hall/N ,/, in/I the/D New/N York/N Academy/N of/I Art/N ./.
In/I fact/N ,/, D.T./` never/P left/V home/N ,/, Carnegie/C Mellon/N University/N in/I Pittsburgh/N ,/, but/R communicated/V with/I its/D human/J handlers/N by/I telephone/N link/N ./.
They/N conceded/V that/I the/D odds/N favored/V Mr./N Kasparov/N ,/, but/V they/P put/V their/P hope/N in/I D.T./N 's/P recently/V enhanced/J capacity/N for/I examining/J positions/N --/: up/R to/T a/D million/C per/C second/N ,/, from/I 720,000/N ./.
But/U the/D handlers/N mistakenly/V stuck/V with/I silicon/N chips/N ;/: they/P needed/J kryptonite/N ./.
This/N became/V apparent/I as/D game/N one/C ,/, a/D Sicilian/N Defense/N by/I Mr./N Kasparov/N ,/, proceeded/V ./.
No/U human/W can/M examine/V millions/N of/I moves/N ,/, but/V Mr./N Kasparov/N ,/, using/V his/P ineffably/` powerful/J brain/N ,/, consistently/V found/V very/R good/J ones/N ./.
After/N eight/C moves/N by/I each/D side/N ,/, the/D board/N was/I the/D same/J as/N in/I a/D game/N in/I which/D Nigel/N Short/N of/I Great/N Britain/N fought/V the/D champion/N to/T a/D draw/N in/I 1980/N ./.
But/U the/D computer/N did/M n't/R play/J Mr./N Short/N 's/P ninth/V move/V ,/, a/D key/J pawn/N thrust/N ,/, and/C its/I position/P deteriorated/J rapidly/N ./.
Instead/N of/I castling/N ,/, a/D standard/N measure/V to/T safeguard/V the/D king/N ,/, D.T./N made/V a/D second-rate/N rook/N maneuver/N at/I move/N 13/N ;/: then/V it/P put/V a/D knight/J offside/N on/I move/N 16/N ./.
``/N Only/N two/C classes/N of/I minds/N would/M think/V of/I this/D --/: very/R weak/V human/J players/N ,/, and/C computers/N ,/, ''/' said/V Edmar/N Mednis/N ,/, the/D expert/J commentator/N for/I the/D match/N ,/, which/W was/V attended/V by/I hundreds/N of/I chess/C fans/N ./.
By/N move/V 21/N ,/, D.T./N had/V fallen/V into/I a/D deep/J positional/N trap/N ./.
It/P allowed/V Mr./N Kasparov/N to/T exchange/V his/P dark-squared/N bishop/N for/I one/N of/I D.T./N 's/P knights/N ./.
Bishops/` usually/R are/V worth/V slightly/R more/R than/I knights/D ,/, but/V in/I this/D case/N Mr./N Kasparov/N was/V left/V with/I a/D very/R dangerous/J knight/N and/C D.T./N 's/P surviving/J bishop/N was/V reduced/V to/T passivity/N ./.
Indeed/N ,/, it/P looked/V more/R like/V a/D pawn/N ,/, a/D ``/N tall/C pawn/N ,/, ''/' as/I spectators/N snidely/N put/V it/P ./.
Consistently/N ,/, D.T./N was/I over-optimistic/N about/I its/D chances/N ,/, which/W it/P continually/V sized/V up/R ,/, in/I numerical/J form/N ./.
When/N most/I spectators/N thought/V its/D position/N hopeless/N ,/, the/D computer/N thought/V it/P was/V only/R ,/, in/I effect/N ,/, one-half/N of/I a/D pawn/N down/R ./.
Such/N evaluations/N met/V with/I derision/N ,/, and/C kept/V the/D machine/N from/I resigning/N as/V soon/R as/V humans/N would/M have/V --/: prompting/F more/J derision/N ./.
While/N D.T./N shuffled/V its/D king/N back/R and/C forth/N in/I a/D defensive/J crouch/N ,/, Mr./N Kasparov/N maneuvered/V the/D knight/N to/T a/D dominant/J outpost/N ./.
He/P also/V launched/V a/D kingside/N storm/N ,/, sacrificing/V a/D pawn/N to/T denude/- D.T./` 's/P king/N ./.
No/U amount/N of/I weasling/N could/M have/V saved/V this/D game/N for/I D.T./N
A/D piece/N down/R ,/, the/D computer/N resigned/N ./.
Now/N ,/, with/I the/D crowd/N in/I the/D analysis/N room/N smelling/N figurative/N blood/N ,/, the/D only/J question/N seemed/V to/T be/V how/R fast/J Mr./N Kasparov/N could/I win/N game/N two/C ./.
With/I the/D advantage/N of/I playing/J white/N -LRB-/N which/W moves/V first/D -RRB-/N ,/, Mr./N Kasparov/N followed/V up/R cleverly/V against/I the/D computer/N 's/P defense/N ,/, a/D Queen/N 's/P Gambit/N Accepted/N ./.
As/N early/I as/D move/N six/C ,/, Mr./N Kasparov/N deviated/N from/I a/D well-known/N sequence/N of/I moves/N ,/, developing/V a/D knight/N instead/V of/I making/V a/D standard/J bishop/N attack/N against/I the/D computer/N 's/P advanced/J knight/N ./.
This/N left/V the/D computer/N with/I a/D broader/J range/N of/I plausible/J replies/N --/: and/C it/P immediately/V blundered/N by/I moving/V a/D queenside/N pawn/N ,/, to/T the/D neglect/N of/I kingside/N development/N ./.
``/N In/I a/D new/J position/N just/V after/I the/D opening/N ,/, a/D computer/N will/M have/V serious/J problems/N ,/, ''/' Mr./' Kasparov/` said/V later/R ./.
In/I such/J positions/N ,/, he/P explained/V ,/, ``/` you/U have/V to/T create/V something/R new/I ,/, and/I the/D computer/N is/V n't/R able/V to/T do/E that/W right/P now/V ./. ''/'
After/N only/I 11/N moves/N for/I each/D side/N ,/, the/D computer/N 's/P position/N was/I shaky/N ./.
Greedily/N ,/, it/P grabbed/V a/D pawn/N ,/, at/I the/D cost/N of/I facing/V a/D brutal/J attack/N ./.
And/N when/I a/D defensive/N move/V was/V called/V for/I ,/, D.T./N passed/V up/R an/D obvious/J pawn/N move/V and/V instead/R exposed/V its/D queen/N to/T immediate/V tactical/J threats/N ./.
Mr./N Kasparov/N remarked/V later/I that/D ``/N even/V a/D weak/J club/N player/N ''/' would/M have/V avoided/V the/D queen/N move/V ./.
Now/N ,/, after/I only/V a/D dozen/J moves/N ,/, spectators/N were/I looking/N for/I a/D mating/J combination/N ./.
On/U a/D demonstration/N board/N ,/, emcee/N Shelby/N Lyman/N showed/I a/D quick/J kill/N initiated/V by/I a/D knight/J sacrifice/N ;/: no/J spectator/N refuted/V this/D line/N of/I play/N ./.
Mr./N Kasparov/N 's/P continuation/N was/V slower/R but/R ,/, in/I the/D end/N ,/, just/R as/V deadly/N ./.
He/P won/V D.T./N 's/P queen/N for/I two/C minor/J pieces/N and/C two/C pawns/C --/: not/R enough/V compensation/N ,/, in/I this/D position/N ,/, to/T give/V the/D computer/N much/R hope/U ./.
In/I a/D hopeless/J position/N ,/, the/D computer/N resigned/V rather/R than/V make/V its/D 37th/N move/V ./.
And/N Mr./N Kasparov/N ,/, to/T cheers/V and/I applause/N ,/, marched/V back/R into/I the/D analysis/N room/N ./.
``/N In/I both/J games/N I/P got/V exactly/R what/W I/P wanted/V ,/, ''/' he/P said/V ./.

Just/N ask/V Richard/N Blumenfeld/N ,/, a/D New/N Jersey/N dentist/N who/W considers/V himself/P ``/V a/D reasonably/J sophisticated/J investor/N ./. ''/'
In/I May/N 1986/N ,/, Dr./N Blumenfeld/N gave/I Merrill/N Lynch/N &/N Co./N about/I $/$ 40,000/C for/I a/D federally/N insured/N certificate/N of/I deposit/N offering/V an/D effective/J yield/N of/I more/R than/I 9/N %/N ./.
``/` It/P was/V a/D time/N when/I interest/N rates/N came/V down/R very/V rapidly/R ,/, ''/' Dr./N Blumenfeld/N recalls/N ./.
Yields/N on/I five-year/N CDs/N at/I major/J banks/N were/I averaging/N about/I 7.45/N %/N ,/, and/C 10-year/N Treasury/N notes/N were/V paying/V less/R than/I 8/N %/N ./.
The/D CD/N seemed/V like/V a/D great/J deal/N ./.
But/C nearly/C 3/N years/N later/I ,/, Merrill/N says/V the/D investment/N is/I worth/C about/C $/$ 43,000/C --/: an/D amount/N that/W represents/I an/D annual/N return/V of/I just/R over/I 2/N %/N on/I Dr./N Blumenfeld/N 's/P $/$ 40,000/C ./.
The/D problem/N is/V that/I the/D CD/N he/P bought/V for/I a/D retirement/N plan/N was/V n't/R a/D plain/N vanilla/N CD/N ./.
Instead/N ,/, his/P Merrill/N broker/N put/V him/P in/I a/D zero-coupon/N CD/N ,/, which/W is/V sold/V at/I a/D deep/J discount/N to/T its/D face/N value/N ./.
The/D difference/N between/I the/D price/N and/I the/D face/N value/N payable/N at/I maturity/N is/I the/D investor/N 's/P return/V ./.
More/U important/J ,/, the/D CD/N was/V purchased/V on/I the/D secondary/N ,/, or/V resale/N ,/, market/N ./.
Because/U the/D CD/N had/I an/D effective/J yield/N of/I 13.4/N %/N when/I it/P was/V issued/V in/I 1984/N ,/, and/C interest/N rates/N in/I general/N had/V declined/J sharply/N since/V then/R ,/, part/N of/I the/D price/N Dr./N Blumenfeld/N paid/V was/I a/D premium/N --/: an/D additional/J amount/N on/I top/N of/I the/D CD/N 's/P base/N value/N plus/N accrued/N interest/N that/W represented/V the/D CD/N 's/P increased/J market/N value/N ./.
Now/U the/D thrift/N that/W issued/V the/D CD/N is/I insolvent/N ,/, and/C Dr./N Blumenfeld/N has/V learned/V to/T his/P surprise/V that/I the/D premium/N is/V n't/R insured/V under/I federal/J deposit/N insurance/N ./.
The/D tip-off/N came/V when/W he/P opened/V a/D recent/J Merrill/N Lynch/N statement/N and/C found/V that/I the/D CD/N 's/P ``/N estimated/V current/J market/N value/N ''/' had/V plummeted/V by/I $/$ 9,000/C in/I a/D month/N ./.
Several/N phone/N calls/V and/I a/D visit/N to/T his/P broker/N 's/P office/N later/I ,/, the/D dentist/N found/V out/R that/I the/D $/$ 9,000/C drop/V represented/V the/D current/J value/N of/I the/D premium/N he/P paid/V when/W he/P bought/V the/D CD/N ,/, and/C that/I the/D amount/N was/I n't/P insured/N ./.
